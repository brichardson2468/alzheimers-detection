# Alzheimer's Detection

## Description of the Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans. The dataset used contains images categorized into four classes: Non-Demented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia.

## Summary of the Question(s) Sought and the Answers
### Questions:
1. Can we accurately classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans?
2. What are the key features in MRI scans that help in distinguishing between different stages of Alzheimer's?

### Answers:
1. Yes, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we achieved an accuracy of X% in classifying the stages of Alzheimer's disease.
2. The key features include variations in brain structure and intensity distributions, which are captured by the CNN model.

## Application of this Knowledge
The knowledge gained from this project can be applied in medical diagnostics to assist radiologists in early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease, potentially leading to better patient outcomes through timely intervention.
